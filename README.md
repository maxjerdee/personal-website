Built with the [quarto framework](https://quarto.org/)

Special categories for the notes posts are roughly supposed to be:
Paper explainer: informal explanation of a paper that we have put out, ideally accompanied by some sort of video explaination
Demo explainer: explanation of some technical details behind the inner workings of a demo

Otherwise I imagine that most of the posts will be explanations of some idea that comes up in my research or something I am generally curious about that has the developed demos embedded within the explanations.
