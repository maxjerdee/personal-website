I am a Physics PhD student at the University of Michigan advised by Prof. Mark Newman. I enjoy researching topics between physics, networks, and statistics ([more info here](publications.qmd)). I also like to build somewhat educational tools and games, mostly housed on this website [here](extras.qmd).
