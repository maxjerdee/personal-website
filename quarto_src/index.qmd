I am a Physics PhD student at the University of Michigan advised by Prof. [Mark Newman](https://websites.umich.edu/~mejn/) and affiliated with the [Center for the Study of Complex Systems](https://lsa.umich.edu/cscs). 

I enjoy researching topics between physics, networks, and statistics ([more info here](research.qmd)) and building somewhat educational tools and games ([check them out](demos.qmd)).
