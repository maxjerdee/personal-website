This in an informal presentation of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04711) done in collaboration with Mark Newman. A talk on this work may be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD7d2-ZWikY).

Hierarchies appear across social settings. In sports, there are good teams and bad teams. Among animals, the top dog chases the bottom dog. For humans, social status appears in who your friends are, the prestige of your workplace, etc... To uncover these rankings, we can apply modeling tools to infer the order of these hierarchies. In doing this, we can also gain insight into the comparative nature of these hierarchies. We find that some settings (most sports) are equitiable and competitive while some hierarchies (most animals) are very unequal and rigid.

## Examples of hierarchies
Many classic examples of hierarchies come from games and sports. Suppose that we observe a series of matches between boxers. We can arrange the outcomes of these matches into a *directed network* where an arrow pointing from boxer A to boxer B indicates that boxer A won over boxer B. From these observations, a natural question arises of who is the best boxer? In the example of @fig-boxers it's not immetiately obvious, everybody has lost at least one match. Fundamentally the decision about what the appropriate way to rank these boxers requires some sort of judgement call about what is valued in a ranking. In this work we take a probabilistic, modeling approach that tries to tell a story about how the wins and losses came to be.
