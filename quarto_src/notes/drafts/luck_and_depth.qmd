This in an informal presentation of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04711) done in collaboration with Mark Newman. A talk on this work may be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD7d2-ZWikY).

Hierarchies appear across social settings. In sports, there are good teams and bad teams. Among animals, the top dog chases the bottom dog. For humans, social status appears in who your friends are, the prestige of your workplace, etc... To uncover these rankings, we can apply modeling tools to infer the order of these hierarchies. In doing this, we can also gain insight into the comparative nature of these hierarchies. We find that some settings (most sports) are equitiable and competitive while some hierarchies (most animals) are very unequal and rigid.

## Examples of hierarchies
Many classic examples of hierarchies come from games and sports. Suppose that we observe a series of matches between boxers. We can arrange the outcomes of these matches into a *directed network* where an arrow pointing from boxer A to boxer B indicates that boxer A won over boxer B. From these observations, a natural question arises of who is the best boxer? In the example of @fig-boxers it's not immetiately obvious, everybody has lost at least one match. Fundamentally the decision about what the appropriate way to rank these boxers requires some sort of judgement call about what is valued in a ranking. In this work we take a probabilistic, modeling approach that tries to tell a story about how the wins and losses came to be.

Groups of social animals often display dominant behavior over each other. Chickens peck, monkeys chase, and dogs growl. I am not an animal behavior expert, but researchers will watch a group of these animals and record . find patterns in their interactions particularly if there is some sort of dominance interaction like the chickens pecking each other the top chicken will more often than not peck the bottom chicken on the ladder Look at monkeys birds dogs in all cases clear hierarchy emerges that we can then use models to understand in lieu of interviewing the chickens. there is also these sorts of models are also frequently applied in consumer preference surveys for example a company might present us will likely consumer with two options red soda blue soda and ask which so did that they prefer and if the consumer prefers the red soda we can interpret this as the red soda has beaten the blue soda. generally it is easier to ask somebody which of the two things they prefer rather than to generate a reliable list of all the options and so these models can be used to aggregate many so called paired comparisons into a ranking of products. getting a bit more creative the model can also be used to describe human context for example friendships if you ask people to name their top five friends most of the time the people that you name don't actually name you Friendship Not always that Bay St. we can interpret this asymmetry as a kind of win if I think someone's my friend but they don't agree then they're somehow cooler than me and they have beaten me. If we make the interpretation and so that there's have done in 3CITATION, we can find that a clear hierarchy emerges. We can even look at faculty to understand some hierarchy of prestige among universities if I graduate from the University of Michigan with a phd and then I get hired by some university X that's kind of like university of Michigan has beaten University X Because the Kyron University respects the fact That I have a degree from University of Michigan. unresist interpretation we can likewise observe these sorts of hierarchies emerge.
