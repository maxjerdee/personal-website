- Based on the SciComm presentation
- When you move faster, your time slows down. 
- Classic example of one twin blasting off in a rocket ship while the other stays at home, by the end of it there is a big difference in ages
- However, our technologies don't go quite this fast, although there are some examples of non-neglible changes in time occuring.
- GPS example of how this matters. 
- Interactive demo (need to use your phone), [link](relativity_demo.qmd) to explanation of how the demo works. 
- Explanation that this is all a result of the idea that there is a single universal speed of light, something has to give. 
- Train derivation of the equation that is then fed into the demo.
- Spacetime, movement as a rotation of spacetime, just like a spatial rotation. 
- Minkowski metric
