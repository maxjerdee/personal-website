- Link to the simulation demo for Newton's cradle
- Define what we mean by a "way of bouncing", a particular sequence of clicks between the balls
- Mention other effects that we could include
- Talk about chaos and non-linear dynamics -> so the ultimate conclusion is that really there are an infinite number of possibilities.
