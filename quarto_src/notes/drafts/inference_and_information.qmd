- Quick review of how we quantify information. (Use the Northeastern example..)
- Equivalence of selecting the parameters that work best for MDL and finding the MAP estimate. 
- Talk about Occam's razor, include a graphic of an example for a particular network
- Talk about how this can also be leveraged in order to compare different classes of models, although frankly I'm not really sure whether that should be used or the model evidence when it comes to trying to quantify the complexity. 
- Link to how we can use sampling methods in order to approximate this model complexity.
