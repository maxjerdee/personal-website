This demo is based upon Figure 12.1 from John Miller's book [A Crude Look at the Whole](https://www.complexityexplorer.org/explore/resources/668-a-crude-look-at-the-whole).

Monte Carlo algorithms are often used to explore probability distributions. Particularly, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is an extremely widely used technique for sampling from distributions. In this story, there are a few frog characters to familiarize ourselves with. 

First up, explorer frog:

- Red
- Doesn't care about flies, wanders to any lilypad.

Next, we have *exploiter frog* (also known as *greedy frog*):

- Blue
- Wants flies, now.

Finally, our most complicated frog will be *sampler frog*:

- Green
- Wants flies, most of the time (!)

In the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, in order to sample from a distribution proportional to $P(x)$, a proposed move from a "state" $x$ to some new state $x'$ will be "accepted" with probability 
$$P_{\text{accept}}(x \rightarrow x') = \min\left(1,\frac{P(x)}{P(x')}\right).$$ 
(really we should be sure our proposals are symmetric, but we won't worry about that in this demonstration). 

In this analogy, the states $x$ are the different lilypads, and the probability $P(x)$ is the number of flies at each lilypad. The frog characters then correspond to the behavior of this Monte Carlo algorithm at different values of $\beta$. Below, you can tinker with these parameters to explore how the distribution of frogs is related to the distribution of flies depending on the $\beta$ parameter.
