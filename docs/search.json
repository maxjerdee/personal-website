    "text": "Play Sound\n\n \nChaotic systems are everywhere in nature. These systems are characterized by the way that small changes can snowball into massive changes in behavior, rendering them hard to predict. For example, in our planet’s climate the flap of a butterfly wing in the right place and right time can cause a hurricane to form. In this interactive demo we leverage the unpredictability of a simple chaotic system known as the Lorentz attractor to remix music recordings in unpredictable ways. Particularly, we split a recording (or “sample”) of music into evenly spaced chunks. A trajectory of the Lorentz attractor is then used to associate each of these pieces of the recording to a point in the system’s phase space. The music is then shuffled by continuing to run the trajectory and playing the chunk associated with the nearest written point in phase space at each step. By harnessing this chaos as a creative force we can play with this ubiquitous feature of the world in an accessible way.\nThis demo made during the 2024 SFI Complex Systems Summer School as part of the Art and Complexity Collective, and was inspired by Liz Bradley’s talks on Nonlinear Dynamics. Particularly, heavy inspiration taken from Diana Dabby’s work (paper, video) on chaotic variations using the Lorentz attractor.",

    "text": "Conway’s game of life is a compact, elegant example of how simple principles can generate complex behaviors. The “game” is played on a 2-dimensional grid, and loosely simulates changes in the population of a species over space and time. Each grid square may either be “alive” or “dead” at each time interval. Only if a grid cell has between 3 and 5 of its 8 neighbors alive will it be alive and happy on the next turn, otherwise it will die of either under- or over-crowding. From this simple rule alone, very complicated behavior can be observed. In this demo we simulate this game of life and play sounds when each of the grid cells is alive. We also mirror our simulation on a Novation Launchpad, an 8 x 8 grid of buttons that can light up with colors. By creating a unified physical, auditory, and visual experience we have an engaging mode to play with this toy example of how complexity can emerge.\nThis demo made during the 2024 SFI Complex Systems Summer School as part of the Art and Complexity Collective.\nIf you plug in a Novation Mini [MK3], you can interact with this demonstration live. That is also what the request to “reprogram your MIDI devices” is about, otherwise you can select “Block” and simply click on the buttons within the browser.\n\n\n\nExample of asking for permissions, unless you are plugging in a Launchpad can select to Block",
