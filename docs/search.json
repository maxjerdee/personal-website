    "text": "My research focuses on the statistical physics of networked systems and aims to understand the regularities and mechanisms underlying observed networks of interactions. Whether examining forces between particles, dominance interactions among animals, or the spread of disease through populations, signatures of emergent complexity such as phase transitions and chaotic dynamics frequently emerge. By studying these phenomena within a unified network science framework, we can address common conceptual and computational challenges. From this interdisciplinary vantage, I seek to leverage tools from statistical physics, information theory, and related fields to enhance our understanding of these complex systems. Many current methods struggle with a tradeoff between realism and statistical rigor. Developing techniques that bridge this tension will advance many scientific applications and inspire new developments in physics."

    "text": "Community detection\nA central problem in network science is community detection: identifying latent groups of network nodes with similar behavior. For instance, a school friend group might be defined as a collection of students who are more frequently connected with each other than with those outside the group. This intuitive definition translates into the stochastic block model (SBM), where the model likelihood represents the probability that a given underlying friend group structure would generate the observed network. By inverting this generative model to perform inference, the SBM identifies the most probable friend groups based on the observed friendships. Although first introduced in this sociological context, the SBM is just a form of Ising model or Potts model. In this correspondence, each site represents a student. If the spin is up, the student belongs to one group; if down, they belong to the other. Just as the ground state configuration of the ferromagnetic Ising model minimizes different-spin neighbors, the best fit to the SBM minimizes unlikely friendships between different groups. Thus, many network inference questions can be recast in physical language and solved with physical tools. The same Monte Carlo algorithms used to find ground states and explore entropically typical configurations can be repurposed to fit network models. I look to refine these methods to extend the application of the stochastic model to settings where it consistently exhibits biases."

    "text": "Scalable inference\nAs network models grow more complex, the demands on the computational tools intensify. Each new model represents a competing hypothesis to explain observed data, making model selection crucial. In semi-supervised cases, where algorithm output is checked against known truths, I develop unbiased information-theoretic measures of similarity to declare winners. In unsupervised settings, ideally I aim to use Bayesian evidence—the probability that a given model generates the observed data—to adjudicate between models. This Bayesian evidence is the free energy of the corresponding physical system, and so we can apply and enhance computational physics techniques to approximate it. As data sets grow larger, Monte Carlo methods for full Bayesian inference become prohibitively expensive, necessitating approximations like mean field methods and belief propagation algorithms. Refining these methods and understanding their asymptotic performance is therefore essential to both the understanding of condensed matter and the rigorous analysis of ever larger data sets."

    "text": "Asymptotic understanding\nNetwork science often deals with pairwise interactions, represented by n x n adjacency matrices where entries denote interaction strength. Random network models thus are interpretable as random matrix models, whose large n limit can be studied with free probability. For instance, the distribution of eigenvalues of random graphs with independent and identical entries famously converges to a semicircle. This control is leveraged to derive the SBM phase transition mentioned earlier. This program has been extremely successful, but many questions in network science now involve hypergraph data, which models higher-order interactions such as among triplets of nodes. These are represented by tensors instead of matrices, necessitating fundamental progress in random tensor theory."

    "text": "Conway’s game of life is a compact, elegant example of how simple principles can generate complex behaviors. The “game” is played on a 2-dimensional grid, and loosely simulates changes in the population of a species over space and time. Each grid square may either be “alive” or “dead” at each time interval. Only if a grid cell has between 3 and 5 of its 8 neighbors alive will it be alive and happy on the next turn, otherwise it will die of either under- or over-crowding. From this simple rule alone, very complicated behavior can be observed. In this demo we simulate this game of life and play sounds when each of the grid cells is alive. We also mirror our simulation on a Novation Launchpad, an 8 x 8 grid of buttons that can light up with colors. By creating a unified physical, auditory, and visual experience we have an engaging mode to play with this toy example of how complexity can emerge.\nThis demo made during the 2024 SFI Complex Systems Summer School as part of the Art and Complexity Collective.\nIf you plug in a Novation Mini [MK3], you can interact with this demonstration live.

    "text": "Play Sound\n\n \nChaotic systems are everywhere in nature. These systems are characterized by the way that small changes can snowball into massive changes in behavior, rendering them hard to predict. For example, in our planet’s climate the flap of a butterfly wing in the right place and right time can cause a hurricane to form. In this interactive demo we leverage the unpredictability of a simple chaotic system known as the Lorentz attractor to remix music recordings in unpredictable ways. Particularly, we split a recording (or “sample”) of music into evenly spaced chunks. A trajectory of the Lorentz attractor is then used to associate each of these pieces of the recording to a point in the system’s phase space. The music is then shuffled by continuing to run the trajectory and playing the chunk associated with the nearest written point in phase space at each step. By harnessing this chaos as a creative force we can play with this ubiquitous feature of the world in an accessible way.\nThis demo made during the 2024 SFI Complex Systems Summer School as part of the Art and Complexity Collective, and was inspired by Liz Bradley’s talks on Nonlinear Dynamics. Particularly, heavy inspiration taken from Diana Dabby’s work (paper, video) on chaotic variations using the Lorentz attractor.",
